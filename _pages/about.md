I am an Eckert Postdoc Fellow at the Bhamla lab and Prausnitz Lab at Georgia Tech where I work on low-cost hardware for intracellular delivery of nucleic acids and biological fluid dynamics.
Before joining Georgia Tech, I received a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Texas Tech University where I worked in Marston lab, studying the hydrodynamics of needle-free drug delivery.
